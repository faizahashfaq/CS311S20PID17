Testing
Students will perform testing of assigned projects. The following issues should be detected during testing:

a) Any type of crashes in application
 ~ No Crash in Application.

b) Issues found in the responsiveness of UI
 ~ Interfaces are well designed.

c) Incorrect results of algorithms
 ~ I notice that if two teachers teach same subject for different section, then both teacher appears in same section for same subjects.
 ~ I notice about labs. The labs contact hours are 3 but its credit hour 1. Labs also scheduling on different days for this. It should be on same day like our university labs time scheduled.

d) Any discrepancies in the features implemented
 ~ Don't feel any repetition in the project.
 
e) Suggestion on the improvement of UI/backend
 ~ Create a Back button. When i add any course or teacher, after adding it automaticaaly go back to the back page. You can use Back button for this.
 ~ It is distinguish between Period 1 and Period 2. You can make it better by making only 1 row for Period 1 or you can also bold Period 1 box as well as other.
   
f) Testing methods can be automated or it can be performed manually.
 ~ It is performed manually

g) Try multiple inputs on algorithms to make it crash and report the scenarios which cause problem
 ~ These is no crash in the program. It is running correctly.

h) All the issues should be reported on Github
